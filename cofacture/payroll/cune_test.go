// TestCune_AnexoTecnicoExample documents an unresolved discrepancy: none of the plausible
// field-formatting variants below reproduce the CUNE that DIAN's Technical Annex (section 8.1)
// publishes for its own worked example. The Annex text was extracted from a PDF, and the
// composition string it prints may itself carry a transcription artifact — the same class of
// issue confirmed and fixed in cude_test.go for the Debit Note worked example (there, the
// Annex's own printed hash didn't match its own printed input string; cude.Compute reproduces
// the mathematically correct hash of that input, not the Annex's typo). Unlike that case, this
// one has NOT been independently resolved: it is not known whether the Annex's CUNE example has
// a similar transcription error, or whether Cune's implementation has a real bug this search
// hasn't found the right input format for.
//
// This test intentionally never fails — it is a documented, ongoing investigation, not a
// correctness check. Cune's actual correctness for the standard format is anchored by TestCune
// above (regression) and, for real payroll submissions, by whether DIAN's certification
// environment accepts a document built with it — see integration-tests/nomina_test.go, which
// does fail (t.Errorf) on a real DIAN rejection, gated behind COFACTURE_TEST_FIXTURES_DIR.
//
// Cune's public signature only accepts cents (int64), so it can only ever produce the
// two-decimal money format — it can no longer be asked to try a "without decimals" variant like
// earlier versions of this search did. That variant is still worth checking (the Annex text is
// ambiguous about it), so it's built and hashed manually below via sha384Hex instead of through
// Cune itself.
