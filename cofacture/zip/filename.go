// responsibility of whoever orchestrates the sending (persistent state), not this package,
// which only formats.

// Note: the text of section 6.5.7/6.5.8 describes the consecutive as hexadecimal ("in the
// range 00000001 <= FFFFFFFF"), but the illustrative example the annex itself gives for the
// "eleventh invoice" shows "00000011" — which in hexadecimal would be the 17th, not the 11th.
// This is an inconsistency in the document, not something that can be resolved from here. This
// function follows the rule's text (hex) because that is the normative reading; if DIAN's
// certification environment turns out to expect decimal, this will need adjusting.
